# This is a mockup of a website for my 
business. It's coded using JS, CSS, and HTML.
It implements query scrolling effects and modals. 
The landing page is very interactive and responsive.

Feel free to use this code and make your own ecommerce 
store for a membership package program, a monthly snack
box for example. Or any other use you may find for it. 

The original set up had a workspace created that implemented
modules, I encountered some problems getting that working,
so there is only one functional JS file for the time being.
A future edition of the web page will implement modules.
